# **How to prepare for the Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning Course**

Data science is the practice of applying statistics to large datasets from a specific domain in order to extract knowledge. In this course we will provide you with the computer and statistical tools for you to become a data scientist on the domain of your preference. The following [welcome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y23h52MZxTA) offers more detail of what a Data Scientist do.

In this course we will be coding in Python due to its many open source libraries used in Data Science. To help you prepare for the course and make learning smooth as possible, I recommend to watch the [video](y) which explains the material in the notebook **PythonDataScience_CrashCourse**. After watching the video and playing with the notebook, download the app **DataCamp**-[website](https://learn.datacamp.com/) and create a **FREE** account. After creating the account try to do the first part of each course in Python and practice the problems as well. To develop an Statiscal intuition please watch [Crash Course: Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH2l6uzC4UEW3iJO4T0qUeUEp_X-f1U7S), from video 2 (What is statistics?) to video 9 (Correlation Doesn't Equal Causation). During the rest of the course we might watch some of the rest of videos from this course.
